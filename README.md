# Build WP Plugins Theme

This is the theme currently powering http://buildwpplugins.com/

Feel free to fork, share, re-compile, blah blah blah :)

Pull requests are also welcome if you see something funky!

This theme is based on _S which you can find at http://underscores.me/

Please note! You most likely cannot use this theme out of the box. I have heavily relied on some Advanced Custom Fields functions to do some things. If you don't have ACF installed, you may get an error or white screen upon activation. I may one day add that stuff to a plugin, but for now, it's in the theme. You have been warned!

My development process includes VVV for the environment and CodeKit for the compilation. The config.codekit file is included in this repo for your convenience (but let's be honest, mostly for my own).
